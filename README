cow-notify, fork from dwmstatus

Notification daemon that runs on background and executes configured command (If there isn't any executes xcowsay)

parses following tags:
[summary] - Replace with summary
[body]    - Replace with body
[expire]  - Replace with expiritation time

By default there is no config file, if you want to execute custom command, then create this file :
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cow-notify/config and type command eg. "xcowsay --image myimage.png [summary] [body]"

note  : Suggest making the config file read only for everyone expect you, so other users can't go and change it to something more dangerous.

note2 : Watch out, it uses simple system( ); function to execute your command, so there might be ways for somebody to notify malicious stuff.
        The code strips out ` and $Â letters, but there might be more ways.

Issues :
	* Fails to reply on some python programs (?)
